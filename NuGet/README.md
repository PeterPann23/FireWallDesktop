Private NuGet packages that are used in the ASP-WAF firewall desktop demo project.

Local NuGet package feeds are simply hierarchical folder structures on your local network (or even just your own computer) in which you place packages. These feeds can then be used as package sources with all other NuGet operations using the CLI, the Package Manager UI, and the Package Manager Console
